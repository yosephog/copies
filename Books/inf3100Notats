DBMS-> Data base mangement system. the software used for data base mangement.
->Data base is a collection of information.
..the database refer to the data that is maneged by the DBMS

	CHAPTER 2

 DATA MODEL.
--> structure of the data,operation of the data,constrain of the data

TWO TYPE OF DATA MODEL
1. tre relatonal model
2. the semistructured-data model, including XML

OTHER DATA MODELS
--> Adding obeject orented feature to the data.
 thus--> valus can have structured rather than being elementry
      --> Relation can have associated methods

Attributs : the column names of a table.
Schema : the name of the the relation and its attributes.
 example--> Movies(title,year,length,genre)
database scheme/relation database schema : one or more schemes.

tupels--> the values of the attributes.(Gone with the wind,1939,231,drama) 
  represantaion R(A,B,C)
componenst-> the values of the attributes. the should be atomic.elementary
type. for example-> Integer,String. not list or arrays.
  represantaion of a scheme
 Movies(title:string,year:integer,length:integer,genre:string)

KEYS OF RELATIONS
--> a set of attributes creats keys.
     Movies(*title,*year,length,genre) * refers keys
 Movis(
	*title: String
	*year: integer
	length: integr 
      )

  2.3 DEFINING A RELATION SCHEMA IN SQL


        CHAPTER 3
 FUNCTIONAL DEPENDANCIES.

Super key-: a set of attributes makeing up a key.

 TYPES OF DEPENDECIES

Trival dependencies-: the dependency of an attribute on a set of attribute where the attribute is the subset of set of attributes.
 example Student(studentId,studentName,subjects)
      studentId,studentName---->> studentId.

Non Trival dependency--: it is the opposite of trival dependency. where an 
attribute is dependant on a set of attribute but the attribute is not a subset of the set of attributes
       studentid,studentName------> subject


Multivalued dependency--: when two attributes are independent of each other.
 for example--: bicyle(bikemodel,year,color)
			(m1001,2007,black), (ml00l,2007,red)
     so the year and colour are independent of each other.


Transitive dependency--: a dependency formed indiractly by two functional depandancy.
              person(book,author,author_age)
              book--> author but author not--> book.
    becuase the book can give you the author. but the author can give you different book.
              author--> authourage


   NORMALIZATION
--> First ,second ,third normal form and BCNF.

FIRST NORMAL FORM(1NF).
.. No two can contain the same amount of information.
   there can be a dublicate attribute values but as the whole. each row is different.
      for example studenttable(name,age,subject)
                   (yoseph,33,biology) (yoseph,33 chemistry)

--> primary key is usully a singe column. but a set of columb is possible
--> differnt column cant be used to fetch the same data.
--> singel values and multiple is not allowed.
          
	NOT (yoseph,33,biology/chemistry)
	 (yoseph,33 chemistry) (yoseph,33,biology) 

--> repeted/redudant but the proper way for 1NF.


 SECOND NORMAL FORM(2NF)

--> if the primery key is a set of attributes then columens that are not part of the primery key needs the entire concateneted attributes for it's existance.
--> if an attribute(not subset of the primery key) depends only on one attribute of the primery key then it fells the 2NF.
		studentTable(studnetname,age,subject)
for example--> primery key : studentName,age  
		studentname--> age (correct) 
		studentname-->subject(incorrect)
		studentName,age-->subject
 


THIRD NORDAL FORM(3NF)

--> every non primery key attributs can be represented by the primery key.
and it shouldnt be possible to use non primery key to represent other attributes.

example-; newStudent(id,name,dob,street,city,state,zip)
  primery key-: id.   so id->name,id->dob
 but by using zip we can get city state zip->city,zip->state

if such value is found we divide it in to two table'
     newStudent(id,nam,dob,zip)  id primery key
     AddressTable(zip,street,city,state) zip primerykey

thus--> dublication is reduced,data integrity achived.


BOYCE AND CODD NORMAL FORM(BCNF)
 
-->MUST BE  in 3NF in th first place.
